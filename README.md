FreeJIT
=======

A WIP experiment to try and JIT free monads.


## What works
- "Free monad" can now JIT
- Problem is, it doesn't support the usual way of encoding "next state" computation:
  cannot do:
```hs
data Lang next = Get Key (\Value -> next) | ...
```
## Roadmap
- [x] Get **some** JIT working
- [ ] Use Template Haskell to JIT the same code at compile time 
- [ ] Inspect functions at compile time to JIT the `Get` kind of computations
